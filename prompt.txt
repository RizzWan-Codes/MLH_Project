You are building a real-world, location-based competitive fitness web app called "Territory Run".

--------------------------------
CORE IDEA (UNDERSTAND THIS FIRST)
--------------------------------

Territory Run turns real-world movement into a competitive game.

Each user represents a moving point on a map using live GPS data from their device.
Every user starts with a small safe zone.

When a user moves outside their safe zone, their path creates a visible trail.
If the user returns back to their safe zone and closes the path into a loop, the enclosed real-world area is captured and permanently added to their territory.

Captured territory increases:
- Total area owned
- Coins (in-game currency)
- Leaderboard rank

If another user crosses a player’s open trail before it is closed, the run fails and no area is captured.

The goal is to move strategically in the real world to claim as much territory as possible without losing an active trail.

--------------------------------
WHY THIS EXISTS
--------------------------------

Many people live sedentary lifestyles and find traditional fitness apps boring or difficult to stick with.

Territory Run motivates physical activity by turning walking or running into a real-time competitive experience.
Users exercise naturally while playing, without feeling like they are “working out”.

--------------------------------
MULTIPLAYER & SERVERS
--------------------------------

Users play inside geographic servers.
Each server represents a limited real-world region (city, campus, or event zone).

Users can:
- Join one server at a time
- Compete only with players inside the same server
- View leaderboards per server

For the MVP, implement only ONE default server.

--------------------------------
GAME ECONOMY
--------------------------------

Users earn coins by:
- Capturing area
- Successfully completing runs
- Maintaining activity streaks (optional)

Coins are stored in Firebase and displayed on the dashboard.

--------------------------------
SAFETY & ETHICS
--------------------------------

The app must:
- Display a safety warning not to run into traffic or restricted areas
- Work only on pedestrian movement
- Handle GPS permission denial gracefully

--------------------------------
TECH STACK (STRICT)
--------------------------------

- HTML (separate files)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN ONLY
- Vanilla JavaScript ONLY
- Firebase v9 modular SDK
- Firebase Authentication (Email/Password + Google)
- Firestore for storing user data

DO NOT use:
- Frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js)
- Backend servers
- Paid APIs
- CSS files

--------------------------------
PAGES TO BUILD
--------------------------------

1) index.html (Landing Page)
2) login.html (Authentication)
3) dashboard.html (Main Application)

--------------------------------
index.html — Landing Page
--------------------------------

Purpose:
Explain the idea clearly to a new user.

Must include:
- Hero section with app name and tagline
- Explanation of how territory capture works in simple steps
- Why it encourages real-world movement
- Call-to-action button → login.html
- Dark modern UI
- Mobile responsiveness

--------------------------------
login.html — Authentication
--------------------------------

Requirements:
- Firebase Authentication
- Login and Signup:
  - Email + Password
  - Google Sign-In
- Handle errors clearly
- Auto-redirect logged-in users to dashboard.html

--------------------------------
dashboard.html — Main Application
--------------------------------

Requirements:
- Block unauthenticated users
- Display:
  - User name
  - Coins
  - Total captured area
- Buttons:
  - Start Run
  - Stop Run
- Use browser Geolocation API to track movement
- Store path coordinates during a run
- Detect when a loop is closed
- Calculate enclosed area (simple polygon math is acceptable)
- Update Firestore on success
- Simulate a basic 2D map using canvas or divs
- Show a leaderboard sorted by total area
- Logout button

--------------------------------
FIREBASE STRUCTURE
--------------------------------

Firestore:
users:
  uid:
    name
    email
    coins
    totalArea

--------------------------------
CODE RULES
--------------------------------

- Provide FULL runnable code for:
  - index.html
  - login.html
  - dashboard.html
- Use comments to explain logic
- Use async/await
- Keep everything MVP-level and hackathon-friendly

--------------------------------
DELIVERABLE FORMAT
--------------------------------

Return the final answer as:
1) index.html
2) login.html
3) dashboard.html


Dont use emojis, always use svg.

lets go with first index.html.
